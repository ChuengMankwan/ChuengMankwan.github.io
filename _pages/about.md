Here is Jinyuan Li.

I am a second-year master student at Tianjin University, guided by Dr. [Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/). My research interests lie in the areas of Multimodal Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Recently, I focus on activating the potential of large language models in more complex multimodal tasks.
